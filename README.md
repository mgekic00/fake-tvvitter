# fake-tvvitter

A simple React application to showcase some good practices. Includes a very poorly written backend just to go along :)
BE requires Maven.

RUN:

cd fake-backend  
mvn clean install -DskipTests  
mvn spring-boot:run    


cd gui  
npm install  
npm start      


Usage:  
Register a new user and login.  
Search for "user" using the search bar and follow user1 and user2, then go to homepage to see some posts :)   
You can also create your own posts.
